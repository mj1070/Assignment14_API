# Assignment14_API
I used DreamFactory to create my API. 
I registered for a 14 day trial.
Selected mysql.
I was sent the following credentials to access my environment.
Instance URL: https://universityofnorthcarolina.apps.dreamfactory.com
Email: mjwesley30@gmail.com
Initial password: nJ1942HP75hemDsYFtUI
I was also sent MySql database credentials.
Host: 198.199.73.149
Database: universityofnorthcarolina
Username: universityofnorthcarolina
Password: I0q5!k3J+Ye&YNZ
I then created a new service and configured it to use the API to access the MySQL database in DreamFactory (See screenshots for configuration).
Once I saved, the API was connected and I reviewed the API docs for the JSON code.
I also tested by pulling in the Employees data from the database.
